# Introduction

WHAT IS LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE?

   1. LMS helps in maintaining data of books issued to learners and books available in library. 

   2. Helps libraries to keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well 
as members profiles and subscription.

Weâ€™ll be creating a Library Software using a server-side database and  Tkinter, which can do all sorts of things.


# Motivation
Due to current circumstances the  management of the workload has been shifted to online platforms. 

It is manually impossible to perform the library procedures so with the help of SQL database server the logs and entries and maintained. 

It is easy to access at any given point of time or place. 

Also it reduces the staff required for each task. Less time consuming.

# Objectives
1. To handle the entire activity of a library. 
2. The software keeps track of all the information about the books and their complete details.
3. The system contains database where all the information will be stored safely.

# Conclusion
SQL database management application which is very well used in the modern world in organising and manipulation a database.

Though SQL does not have the GUI we have integrated with python to manage the database comfortably.

Depending on the user or users, if an organisation has multiple users then they should go for SQL server based application.

This project shows how to create tables in SQL and how to create simple data manipulation language and data definition language with how to execute them.
